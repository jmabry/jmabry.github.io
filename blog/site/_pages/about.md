I am a data scientist and engineer with experience spanning consulting, biotech, and academic research.

I like building large-scale systems that blend experimentation, modeling, and optimization. I have designed and analyzed thousands of experiments throughout my career and so I try to keep adding to this spike, while picking up other tools I need to be effective (MLOps, Causal Inference, Cloud / Data Engineering, GenAI...).

On this blog, I share technical insights from building ML systems, code snippets, and the occasional thoughts on working as a data science and engineering leader.
